1
    - Initial release to an unsuspecting world
    - This is mostly a testing release and not yet recommended for normal use.

2
    - Fix download and self-update command

3
    - Download less during builds by using `--git-cache-dir` rakudo option on
      newer rakudos
    - Add `rakubrew-version` command to list version and some debug info
    - Fix `download` and `self-upgrade` commands
    - Don't error on startup when a broken version is present (e.g. a failed
      build)
    - Fix `shim` mode on Windows
    - Accept "moar-2020.01" style versions in addition to "moar 2020.01" in
      `build` and `download` commands

4
    - Hopefully make it run on older MacOS as well by switching to a different
      Perl distribution. (#3)
    - Enable building Rakudos on MacOS even though Rakudo currently doesn't
      support building in a folder with spaces. This only works with new enough
      Rakudos.

5
    - Change default installation directory to ~/.rakubrew and C:\rakubrew.
    - Better detect Configure.pl options. This should increase compatibility
      with older Rakudo releases.
    - Warn user when installing to a folder with spaces in its path.
    - Add some minimal testing of rakubrew.
    - Fix build version shell auto completion.

6
    - Move to Dist::Zilla as packaging tool.
    - Tune documentation a bit.

7
    - Fix `download` and `self-upgrade` commands on Linux when not having
      IPC::Run3 installed.
    - Fix `download` and `self-upgrade` commands on MacOS and Windows.

8
    - Fix more bugs in `self-upgrade` command. Tested on Linux and Windows.

9
    - Fix `download` command on MacOS. Now actually tested on MacOS!
    - Default to `moar` backend in `build` and `download` commands.

10
    - Implement Tcsh support. The implementation includes auto-complete.
    - Fix `test` and `triple` commands.

11
    - Improve Tcsh detection when the shell is named 'csh'.
    - Be a bit more robust in the Tcsh hook.

12
    - Fix "Couldn't find a precomp release" with the download command when
      there actually is a matching release but some other release has a higher
      build revision.

13
    - Add a note to the PowerShell and CMD installation instructions explaining
      that one needs to install rakubrew separately for the two shells.
    - Fix Zsh shell integration.

14
    - Download command will now honour the specified backend. (mendel)
    - Add some tests for the shell hooks. (JJ)
    - Fix and improve shell completion some more. Now supports completing
      partial matches in the middle of a word and help topics. (vrurg, mendel)
    - Report missing external build tools instead of erroring out.
    - Detect `armhf` and `arm64` architectures, fixing `list-available` and
      `download` commands on arm systems (prominently the RasPi). Note that
      there currently aren't any precompiled rakudo versions for arm available
      though.
    - Fix shell hook on PowerShell 7.

15
    - Fix logic to automatically switch to a version after install.
    - Fix `shim` mode on Windows.
    - Fix `download` when the latest compiled release <> latest release.
    - Allow specifying a version with the `build-zef` command.
    - Improve version completion of the `build` and `download` commands.

16
    - Fix a warning when building zef

17
    - Improve arch detection of x86 32bit on Linux (maybe others). This will
      improve the error message one receives on such systems when using the
      `download` command. As there are currently no precompiled releases
      available for that platform, the `download` command will still not
      work on such systems though.
    - Fix reinstalling zef.

18
    - Fix `build-zef` for registered versions. With registered versions
      `build-zef` previously littered CWD with a zef checkout. Not anymore.

19
    - No end user facing changes. Improve internal folder structure.

20
    - Adapt install instructions for zsh to recommend `.zshenv` over
      `.zshrc`. The latter is even available in scripts.
    - Fix setting the local version
    - Detect broken installations. They are now flagged in `list` and switch to
      such a version is prevented.
    - Fix the `shell` command in env mode.

21
    - Fix switching versions in env mode which broke in the previous release.

22
    - Fix `register` command with relative paths.

23
    - Fix arch detection on Apple M1. This solves the problem of M1 users only
      receiving the x86_64 builds when using the `download` command.

24
    - Fix arch detection on Apple M1 when using the fat-packed x86_64 rakubrew.

25
    - CPAN only release with no functional changes. Remove some large files that
      accidentally slipped into the release archive.

26
    - Switched default of Git protocol from `git` to `https`, following GitHub
      disabling the `git` protocol.

27
    - Fix building JVM. Previously builds of the JVM succeeded, but Rakubrew
      considered the resulting version as broken.
    - Make Rakubrew more resilient to errors resulting from broken versions.
      Previously Rakubrew would error on certain commands if a broken version
      was present.
    - Make the `register` command platform independent.
    - Add some more testing.
    - Make sure the Windows shim wrappers modifying the environment. Previously
      they added a `command` and `brew_cmd` env var.
    - Try to reverse the effects of the PAR wrapper on the environment on
      MacOS. Previously on MacOS several env vars were added and
      `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` was modified in shim mode on MacOS.
    - Switch shims to use `symlink` instead of `link` on *nix. That should
      allow for having the shims on a different partition from the rakubrew
      executable.

28
    - Be correcter and more robust when building zef on older Rakudo versions
      by using `-I.` instead of `-Ilib`.
    - Correctly set the versions name when using `download` without an explicit
      version number.
    - Fix `download` command to pick the correct version, even when some older
      version has a higher build revision number.
    - Upgrade Github URLs in existing repositories to not use the disabled
      `git` protocol.

29
    - Upgrade Github URL in the zef repository as well. Missed it in the last
      update.
    - Detect S390 architecture.
    - Hint at the `build` command, when no precompiled release is available.

30
    - Update zef default branch name from master to main.

31
    - Track the master -> main branch rename in rakudo.

32
    - Change master -> main also in moar-blead.

33
    - Fix `moar-blead` command. Moar didn't change branch names.

34
    - More detailed error reporting in `download` s unzip on Windows.
    - Provide a MacOS on ARM build of Rakubrew.

35
    - Remove trash files from CPAN release.

36
    - Fix `self-upgrade` on ARM MacOS.
                                **IMPORTANT**
      When you are on an ARM MacOS and use the new ARM build of Rakubrew, this
      update *WILL* break your installation (Rakubrew will install an x86_64
      build). To work around this misery you need to manually do the update by
      downloading https://rakubrew.org/macos_arm/rakubrew and replacing your
      instance with it (usually located in `~/.rakubrew/bin/rakubrew`).

37
    - Change master -> main in MoarVM as well.

38
    - On some MacOSes the `sysctl` executable is not in path. Try more places
      to find it. This should fix `download` on such OSes.
    - Fix `download` on Windows (when the user doesn't happen to have
      Strawberry Perl installed.)

39
    - Fix detection of x86 PowerShells. Before this change when calling
      Â´rakubrew init` on an x86 PowerShell, one would be presented with the
      CMD installation instructions.

40
    - Implement `exec --with some-version`.

41
    - Fix `build-zef` on Windows.

42
    - Hopefully improve PowerShell detection.
    - In `init` tell users which shell was detected and how to correct it if it
      was detected wrongly.

43
    - Improve documentation of the `build` command.
    - Guard against unsupported use of the `--prefix` build option.
    - Warn appropriately when a `build` command did not result in a working
      Rakudo installation.
